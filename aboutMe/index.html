    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Brenda Tondin</h2>
    <p>Hey there everyone, my name is Brenda as you know already, I'm a web design student here in BYUI and I'm looking
        forward to work as an UI/UX designer. I love the opportunity BYUI is giving me to study more and more about the
        things I love.
        I'm from Rio de Janeiro/Brazil and I am a member of the church since I was born. I`m excited for this semester
        with you all, hope we can get along and have a great time together.
    </p>
